### 1. System requirements
- MATLAB 2018b or later version
- Installation of the Deep Learning Toolbox (https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html)
- Installation of the pretrained AlexNet (https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/59133-deep-learning-toolbox-model-for-alexnet-network)
- No non-standard hardware is required.
- Uploaded codes were tested using MATLAB 2018b and 2019b.


### 2. Installation
- Download all files and folders. ("Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP")


### 3. Instructions for demo
- 'Figure1_4.m' and 'Figure5.m' perform a demo version (a fewer set of stimuli than in the paper) of simulation using two conditions of the network.
- Expected running time is about 5 minutes for each file, but may vary by system conditions.
